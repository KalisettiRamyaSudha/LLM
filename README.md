Understanding Large Language Models

**What is an LLM?**
An LLM is a neural network designed to understand, generate, and respond to human-like text. These models are deep neural networks trained on massive amounts of text data.
The “large” in “large language model” refers to both the model’s size in terms of parameters and the immense dataset on which it’s trained.

A key component of transformers and LLMs is the self-attention mechanism (not shown), which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words or tokens in a sequence relative to each other. This mechanism enables the model to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships within the input data, enhancing its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant output.
